# clj-cron-parse

A Clojure library for using cron expressions.

The library mainly consists of one function, `next-date`, which takes a cron expression and a from date and returns the
next `org.joda.time.DateTime` to occur for that cron expression.  From this function you should be able to do anything
you want using cron expressions.

## Usage

(require '[clj-cron-parse.core :refer [next-date]])
(def now (t/date-time 2015 01 01 12 00 00 000))

    (next-date now "1 * * * * *"))

    (next-date now "@yearly"))
```
